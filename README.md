# rich-presence
 Discord rich presence v12 with available buttons
## QUICK GUIDE!
 What you will need:
Go to discord applications: https://discord.com/developers/applications
Create an app and copy its id, then replace applicationID in the index file to your application id.
To show images on the rich presence you'll need to go upload images that are 512x512 minimum after that go back to your index.js and change large_image | small_image to the image name that you uploaded.
In the image_text fields just write whatever you want!

Have fun with it (:
